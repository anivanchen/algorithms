# Fibonacci Number

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers include the following sequences, called the Fibonacci sequence, which can be characterized by the fact that for every number after the first two `0, 1`, the number is the sum of the preceding two.

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, ...`

F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub> where n > 1.
