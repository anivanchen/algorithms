# Greatest Common Divisor (Greatest Common Factor)

In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For two integers `x`, `y`, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is denoted `gcd(x, y)`. The word "divisor" may be replaced by "factor".
